## Inspiration

**Cryptocurrencies are often talked about today in the context of huge investments** – and their attendant controversies – made by personalities such as Elon Musk.

Activities across globe has **piqued the interest of corporate treasurers**. Organizations, have expressed interest in cryptocurrency initially as a fringe method of collection, a potential experiment for
their foundations and even as an outlet for excess cash. 

Confident that this platform will spark new thinking in payment infrastructure, processing, an accounting, in addition to its increasing adoption as a store of value.

Rather than leveraging agent model - escrow account where a trusted third-party holds deposits on organization behalf. Once a client or customer pays the company using crypto, the agent then collects the cryptocurrency, holding the private key on behalf of the organization. From here, the organization can either keep crypto with the third party or request that it be converted to USD or another fiat currency – then transferring the funds to a bank account. They can keep the crypto position in the hands of the agent, or alternatively, they can request that the agent convert the crypto to USD or another fiat currency and then transfer the funds to a preferred bank account. 

**Detreman DApp brings capability for direct model where a company holds and controls its own private keys**. They operate as a direct participant with their own wallet and accept the crypto directly from the remitter. Our Solution builds **user friendly intuitive interface over blockchain transactions to allow customers to safeguarding of user privacy, the lack of censorship, and Increased Trust on the System**. **This is going to be future of treasury management and we are ready for it**. 

A remitter can be an individual, a wallet provider, the exchange, or the custodian of the remitter. This approach requires a certain level of accounting and treasury expertise, especially if the company has chosen to hold crypto on its balance sheet. Typically, the receiving organization does not convert the crypto to fiat. Instead, the company holds the private key as a bearer instrument for their crypto.


## How we built it

We have built the systems by leveraging Outsystems Low code platform, .Net, java script

## Challenges we ran into

Cross chain and currency support were few challenges that we faced.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Next gen User experience for treasury function users with support of Near. There is another burning issue that may be holding back some treasury investors; that of current environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns around certain cryptocurrencies. Recent controversy around power consumption and coin mining being front of mind for many. Good aspect is Near blockchain validates new tokens through proof of stake, a far less energy-intensive protocol structure than the traditional proof of work that other major cryptocurrencies rely on.


## What we learned

Never the dead end for learning. This is continuous journey.

## What's next for DeTreMan 
Platform integration into treasury management practices and policies of organization on what accounting rules apply towards risk management practices.

Still many questions that overhang the crypto space and regulation is likely to continue to unfold; should regulation harden, the second part of the equation becomes enforceability.
